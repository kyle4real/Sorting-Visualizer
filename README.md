# Sorting Visualization App

This app allows the user to visualize various sorting algorithms with a bar graph and colorized animations.  It was built using React and SASS.

## Algorithms Implemented

The three algorithms implemented are bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

## Data Sorted

The data is generated at random, and the user can decide how many data points to use, as well as how the data is initially structured (random or nearly sorted)

# How To Use

To start, choose the sorting algorithm you wish to see, and then choose the amount of data along with the structure of the data. Once the data points (bars) are visable, you can choose the speed at which the animations should run by adjusting the bar next to the play button, once configured, press the play button to begin the sorting animations.

To visualize the sorting algorithms side-by-side, click the toggle bar in the top right corner of the app. This page allows you to complete the steps outlined above for up to four different blocks, and on play, each block will play at the same time.
